### Features

- **Add Task**: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to your to-do list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Click on a task to mark it as completed. It will be visually crossed out.
- **Simple Styling**: The app comes with basic styling to make it visually appealing.

### How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https: https://github.com/denyzabra/Todolist/
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. To add a new task, type the task in the input field and click the "Add" button.

4. To mark a task as completed, click on the task in the list. Click it again to unmark it.

### Code Explanation

The core functionality of the app is implemented in the `script.js` file. Here's a breakdown of what's happening in the JavaScript code:

- The `addTask` function is responsible for adding new tasks to the list.
  - It retrieves the task text from the input field.
  - Creates a new list item (`<li>`) to represent the task.
  - Adds an event listener to each task item, allowing you to mark tasks as completed by clicking on them.
  - Appends the new task item to the task list (`<ul>`).

### Contributing

### 3. Task Categories or Prioritization

Task: Develop a feature that lets users categorize tasks or assign priorities (e.g., high, medium, low).

Explanation: Task categorization or prioritization enhances task management, especially for users with extensive to-do lists.

### 4. Due Dates and Reminders

Task: Add the ability for users to set due dates and reminders for their tasks.

Explanation: Introducing due dates and reminders can transform this app into a comprehensive task management tool, helping users stay organized and meet deadlines.

### 5. User Accounts

Task: Implement user accounts and authentication to allow users to save and access their to-do lists from different devices.

Explanation: User accounts provide a personalized experience, enabling users to access their tasks from anywhere and facilitating list sharing.

### 6. Sorting and Filtering

Task: Create options for users to sort tasks based on various criteria (e.g., due date, priority) or filter tasks by specific conditions.

Explanation: Sorting and filtering capabilities make it easier for users to find and focus on the tasks that matter most to them.

### 7. Improved Styling

Task: Enhance the visual design and user interface to improve the app's aesthetics and user-friendliness.

Explanation: A well-designed interface can make the app more inviting and intuitive to use.

### 8. Mobile Responsiveness

Task: Ensure the app functions seamlessly on different screen sizes and devices by making it mobile-responsive.

**Explanation:** Mobile responsiveness broadens the app's usability, allowing users to manage tasks on smartphones and tablets.

### 9. Data Export/Import

Task: Enable users to export their task data to a file or import tasks from external sources.

Explanation: Data export/import features simplify tasks such as data backup and migration between apps.

### 10. Keyboard Shortcuts

Task: Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions like adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, or navigating the task list.
