```javascript
// Function to add a new task
function addTask() {
```

- This line starts by defining a new function called `addTask`. In JavaScript, functions are blocks of reusable code that can perform specific tasks.

```javascript
    const taskInput = document.getElementById("task");
```

- Here, we create a constant variable called `taskInput`. Constants (declared with `const`) cannot be changed once defined.
We use the `document.getElementById("task")` method to retrieve an HTML element with the `id` attribute set to "task." In JavaScript, `document` represents the webpage, 
and `getElementById` is a method to access elements on the page.

```javascript
    const taskText = taskInput.value.trim();
```

- We create another constant called `taskText`. We set it equal to the value inside the `taskInput` element, 
which is the text entered by the user into the input field.
The `.trim()` function is used to remove any extra whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.) from the beginning and end of the text.

```javascript
    if (taskText !== "") {
```

- This line checks whether `taskText` is not an empty string.
The `if` statement is used for conditional execution. If the condition inside the parentheses is true (in this case, `taskText` is not empty),
the code inside the curly braces will be executed.

```javascript
        const taskList = document.getElementById("task-list");
```

- Similar to what we did earlier, we retrieve an element with the `id` attribute set to "task-list." This will be the list where we display our tasks.

```javascript
        const newTaskItem = document.createElement("li");
```

- We create a new HTML list item element (`<li>`) and store it in the `newTaskItem` constant. This is where we will display the task text.

```javascript
        newTaskItem.innerText = taskText;
```

- We set the text content of the `newTaskItem` to be the value of `taskText`. In other words, we display the task text inside the newly created list item.

```javascript
        // Add a class for styling
        newTaskItem.classList.add("task");
```

- We add a CSS class called "task" to the `newTaskItem` element. This is for styling purposes. It allows us to apply specific styles to these task items,
like changing their appearance when they are completed.

```javascript
        // Add a click event listener to mark a task as completed
        newTaskItem.addEventListener("click", function () {
            this.classList.toggle("completed");
        });
```

- We attach a "click" event listener to the `newTaskItem`. This means that when a user clicks on a task, 
the code inside the function will run. In this case, it toggles (switches on and off) the "completed" class for the clicked task,
which visually marks it as completed or uncompleted.

```javascript
        taskList.appendChild(newTaskItem);
```

- Finally, we append (add) the `newTaskItem` (the list item with the task text) to the `taskList` (the list where all tasks are displayed). 
This effectively adds the new task to the list.

```javascript
        taskInput.value = "";
```

- We clear the input field by setting its value to an empty string. This way, the field is ready for the user to input their next task.

```javascript
    }
}
```

- This closing curly brace (`}`) marks the end of the `if` block, which means that if the `if` condition (checking for non-empty `taskText`) is not met,
the code inside the block is skipped.

So, in summary, this JavaScript function adds a new task to a to-do list when called. It takes the user's input from an HTML input field, 
creates a new list item element, associates it with a click event listener to toggle completion, and adds it to the task list. 
It also clears the input field to prepare for the next task.
